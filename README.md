# Product-Recognition-on-Store-Shelves
Product Recognition on Store Shelves, project made in Python.

In this folder, you can finde the pdf that is basically the report of the entire project. This project is split in 2 steps, we called them step A&B and step C. In the first step (A&B), we take into account simple scenes in which we analyze our models (all the models and scenes are contained in the two folders inside step_A_B folder) whereas in the second step we studied some algorithms to better approach very hard scenes, with the same models.

Project made with Ludovica Ghinelli.
